# Let's Do This

## Approach

- Took some time looking at the data to see what can be useful for an organiser as an extra feature
- decided to go for displaying the sales for the event that is entered
- If I had more time was contemplating going for a function that shows if a runner is eligible for a refund using the 4-day refund policy
